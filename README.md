# Advent of Code Solutions ðŸŽ„  

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual coding challenge that takes place every December. Each folder corresponds to a specific year, with solutions written in Python.  

A huge thanks to Eric Wastl for creating and maintaining this project, which I (we?) get to enjoy every holiday season.


## Notes  
These solutions are personal and may not always represent the most efficient or elegant approach. If you're looking for outstanding explanations and techniques, I highly recommend checking out [hyper-neutrino's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino).  

Happy coding! ðŸŽ…
